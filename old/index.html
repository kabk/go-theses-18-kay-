      <p id="abstract">We live in a visual-oriented world. Especially for those, including myself, who pursue the job of a designer.For us who’s practice consists of almost only visual purposes, it is crucial we question the importance of that particular perception we use the most. This profession brings a lot of visual conditions on top of our already existing pictorial obsession. Seeing is part of a collective unconsciousness we all share. I want to find out what caused this shift and if there are any alternatives to the current sensory hierarchy. Is this notion of visual domination true or is it merely an assumption? What happens when one of our sense organs stops functioning and what are the right substitutions for it. My main goal of writing this text is to find out how our vision can possibly make room for other senses. Perhaps limiting our focus on vision will make us see better.</p>

         <h1 id="braille">SEE</h1>
      <p>We see to believe, we see to understand and we see to justify. We believe our seeing is proof positive.1 We are relying on our sense of vision to capture the action or mood. The act of seeing is widely used in language, sayings and symbolism; Let's see—I see—I see what you mean—I see what you did there—I see where you're coming from—First see, then believe—See for yourself—You see?—See you!</p>

      <p>The eye is the symbol of protection and life, the window to the soul, the omnipresent spirit of God, watchful over those who serve. It is a passageway into a new dimension, the light of the body. It confesses the secrets of the heart. It represents intelligence, light, vigilance, moral conscience and truth.2
      The eye is by far the most symbolized and spiritualized sense of the human body. Sight is by many the most praised and highest valued sense. According to various sources, 80 to 90 percent of all the information that is transmitted to the brain is visual. 60 percent of the people are visual learners and 50 percent of the brain is dedicated to the visual function.3Our beloved marbles can make rapid movements. This Is called a saccade and they can occur at a maximum peak rate of about 900 degrees per second—which is about 0.68 kph. That may seem slow, but imagine them rolling down the streets.</p>

      <p>In 2014 a study by Professor Mary C. Potter and colleagues at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge) revealed that the brain can process and interpret images presented to the eyes for as little as 13 milliseconds.4 And it is believed that visuals are processed 60.000 times faster than text. Which is why one could argue that ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. We love this sense by heart, most of us will choose it over other senses and would never trade it.</p>

      <p>The eye is unique, one of a kind. Every single iris is different—like a fingerprint—and each iris can indicate different individual characteristics. This has been discovered by scientists from the Orebro University in Sweden. After a study of 428 individuals, their findings showed those with densely- packed crypts (threads which radiate from the pupil) are 'gentle, tender-mindedness, warmth, trust and positive emotions' In comparison, those with more furrows in the iris were more 'neurotic, impulsive and likely to give way to cravings.’ 5 So in a way, it is actually true that the eyes are ‘the window to the soul.’
      Although this discovery or scientific proof dates back from 2007, designers seemed to have always used the eye to attract attention. Think of the numerous movie posters that have a gigantic staring eye in the centre. They usually try to capture the whole story within one image of the eye. It can show the vulnerableness of a victim in a horror movie, or the evil monster that is up to no good. An eye can show a lot of emotions. Which is exactly why it is so widely used in advertising. They lure us into the poster or image.</p>

      <p>We think of our eyes as tools that show us all the wisdom and truth around us. They are ‘wise seers’ and generate a clear vision and true interpretation of how we perceive the world. However, all the eye does is gather light. Seeing, as we think of it, doesn’t happen in our eyes but in our brain. We are seeing life in fast-forward and our visual brain predicts future events based on past experience. This becomes clear when one is exposed to (optical)illusions. “If the eye’s powers are appreciated by science, so too are its limitations”. 6 For instance the 'Vanishing Ball Illusion’. 7 A very basic trick where the magician throws up a ball a couple of times and on the final throw, he pretends to throw it up while actually holding it back. Our mind is predicting future scenarios all the time and this time it predicted how the ball would go up—so it makes the illusion of it vanishing in mid air.</p>

      <p>In fact, every single visual experience could be an illusion: 
      Humans can see only a fraction of the light waves of the total spectrum; the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve connects with the retina; human vision is limited by its capacity to focus on objects only a certain distance from the eye; visual experiences might turn out to be illusions.8
      While a lot of species use other senses as their main guidance through life, most people rely on their eyes—and even more so—they are obsessed with it. Our obsession for imagery has caused a global visual overload.9 We have a greed for imagery and demand them with everything. Text, music and radio- shows are accompanied by images. Throughout the twentieth century, imagery has increasingly infiltrated the urban landscape. Roadsigns and billboards have become a large element of our perception of the world and it would feel empty without it. Even outside of the city we can’t escape from visual bombardments. We almost don’t see them anymore which is why advertisers are trying so hard to stand out from others and attract attention. They have to shout at us in order for us to see or hear them. An eye-catcher from a few years ago might now be just a blur to us.</p>

      <p>The eye has not always been at the top. Not even second—but found itself third place in the hierarchy of the senses. In ‘The Problem of Unbelief in the Sixteenth Century’, Lucien Febvre argues: ‘The sixteenth century did not see first: it heard and smelled, it sniffed the air and caught sounds. It was only later, as the seventeenth century was approaching, that it seriously and actively became engaged in geometry, focusing attention on the world of forms. It was then that vision was unleashed in the world of science as it was in the world of physical sensations, and the world of beauty as well’10 And that is exactly what happened, we started focussing on form, composition and aesthetics. Which caused good and bad results. We might now have better guidance in finding ways and we can see beauty in daily objects, but it also withholds experience— which may seem invisible to us—but affects us drastically; It affects us physiologically and psychologically. It affects our health, behavior, productivity and so our accuracy. Noise levels in hospitals and healthcare facilities have doubled since 197211—which increased substantially dispensing errors. Modern architecture focusses on form and functionality, but takes acoustic experience for granted. Julian Treasure (Public speaker and CEO of The Sound Agency in U.K.) therefore asked himself the question: ‘Do architects have ears?’ Classrooms and offices are designed too open and causes them to be too noisy. Less than half of the pupils can hear the teacher without loosing focus caused by a big vibration time. A solution could be subdividers but they break up the spaces into tiny, uncomfortable sizes.12 On the other hand, too quiet isn’t good either. It creates an unpleasant atmosphere where sudden sounds can become too striking since it is the only detectable source at that time.</p>
